# R.nanorc -- nano syntax-highlighting file for R
#
# Origin: This file is part of the pkgutils package for R.
#
# Usage: This file should be placed in a directory such as /usr/share/nano/ (on
#   Ubuntu 12.04). That nano uses syntax highlighting at all might need to be
#   enabled separately.
#
# Limitations: The syntax is covered as completely as possible; for instance,
#   all reserved words are marked in a uniform way. That R syntactical names
#   may contain dots, however, appears to make it impossible to hightlight
#   them properly using nano's limited regular-expression capabilities.
#
# NB: This syntax highlighting distinguishes between normal and Roxygen-style
#   comments.
